# QueasyCarBoy's Boat Races

Hello! As we are expanding in terms of boat races, I decided to make this repository. This also allows me to make an actual website, track PBs, and explain every track.

## Track #1: Rainbow Road

This track is the first track I ever shared. It was meant to be the successor to another boat racing track on my YouTube channel, but I never released the predecessor. Anyways, this track is pretty difficult, since I didn't know much about making boat races back then.

**Release date:** July 21st, 2024

## Track #2: The Path of the Devil

This track was made when I just felt like "What if I made a track too hard?" And so this was born. It had all the signs that this was an atrocious track: its combination of length, narrowness, tight turns and layout basically made it like a mental marathon. My time goal was 10 minutes, but it ended up being a track that's almost 20 minutes.

**Release date:** February 18th, 2025

## Track #3: The Labyrinth of Nightmares

One day a friend of mine suggested a boat track with phantoms. While this track is phantom-free, it had many other elements that made it very fear-inducing. It's incredibly fast, decently narrow, very purple-looking, and it can get extremely competitive, especially on frosthex. Also, this is my shortest track because the WR holder decided it shouldn't be longer than 2 minutes.

**Release date:** March 23rd, 2025

**Server release date (frosthex):** April 6th, 2025

## Track #4: Space Road

When I made the Labyrinth of Nightmares, I was frustrated by the time limit. So I said, "You know what? Screw it. Let's get a long enough track and focus all points on speed." The result? An incredibly fast track (the second fastest, as I am writing this).

**Release date:** May 7th, 2025

## Track #5: Titanic Monarch

Around this time, I was getting inspired by Sonic. More specifically, its banger soundtracks. My favourite track at the time was Ruby Illusions, also known as the final boss of Sonic Mania. I started making a track around the actual zone and ended up releasing it under the same name.

**Release date:** May 23rd, 2025

## Track #6: Broken Rainbow Road

I kinda delayed BRR a lot. I mean, it was supposed to be just after the Labyrinth of Nightmares. But no, smartass me focused on Space Road and Titanic Monarch before. Anyways, if it isn't already clear, this is Rainbow Road's sequel. Totally new style, shortened it to just below 3 minutes, and made it a little faster as well, almost matching Titanic Monarch's speed.

**Release date:** June 8th, 2025

## Track #7: Through the Fire and Flames

One day I was constantly reminded by the fact that Space Road did not reach 300 cm/t. Frustrated and knowing what happened, I released this track. What I claim to be the successor of Space Road (in speed) and of the Path of the Devil (in design). It got so fast that I genuinely had a warning sign about the speed. If you are good, thankfully you can reach 300 cm/t averages.

**Release date:** July 6th, 2025

## Track #8: Metallic Madness

I really liked Sonic CD's final boss soundtrack. This was the name of the final zone in Sonic CD, so I made a track around it. Also, I spectacularly failed the average speed (was meant to be 270 cm/t, but in practice, it barely ended up over 200). And I guess I never liked it that much. But hey, that's still progress.

**Release date:** July 25th, 2025

## Track #9: Stardust Speedway

Now, this is a track I genuinely like. Not its design, but the fact it is fast, and really, really long, like longer than the Path of the Devil in terms of kilometers. But because of its much faster s[...] And yeah, I took Sonic Mania's Metal Sonic battle for this one.

**Release date:** August 21st, 2025

## Track #10: Mystic Road

As I am approaching the 10th track, I wanted to do something E P I C. So here it is. By far the longest track I ever have. 200km. An entire hour. Oh yeah, to make this an epic journey I made 9 sections, each themed like the previous ones. I wanted to release this at Rainbow Road's 1st anniversary, but I am delaying this to my birthday, along with this webpage. So... Happy birthday to me! (I am now 22, but that doesn't change a thing about my behaviour).

**Release date:** August 21st, 2025
